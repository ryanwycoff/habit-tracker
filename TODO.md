1. i want to make sure all my information is safe, in case safari loses its memory. create a way to save and manipulate all the data from the app onto my local iphone instead of in safari. the local data should be updated live as I use the app. 
2. Make sure all UI components fit perfectly into a portrait iPhone. I only want to be able to scroll the page up and down and see all UI components completely. 
3. remove import button from bottom panel. 
4. remove the "Up next" UI component
5. refine the UI for ease of use on an iPhone
6. remove habit categories and notes for habits in a specific day from the project entirely. in the management panel, I should be able to edit habits directly. But, instead of each schedule item getting its own title, you should be able to only select a habit for that day and time.
