1. for your information, everything works in google chrome on my iphone as well. but, I want my data to be safe, in case my google chrome data is lost. create a way to save and manipulate all the data from the app onto my local iphone instead of in browser storage. the local data should be updated live as I use the app. 
2. Make sure all UI components fit perfectly into a portrait iPhone. I only want to be able to scroll the page up and down and see all UI components completely. 
3. remove import button from bottom panel. 
4. remove the "Up next" UI component
5. refine the UI for ease of use on an iPhone
6. remove habit categories and notes for habits in a specific day from the project entirely. in the management panel, I should be able to edit habits directly. But, instead of each schedule item getting its own title, you should be able to only select a habit for that day and time. 
7. The selected day in the calendar should be highlighted blue, while the current day should be highlighted with the same style but grey. 
8. changing the status of an item on the schedule in the main UI should not change the status of all schedule items with the same habit assigned. one habit could be in the schedule multiple times throughout a single day/week. I want to be able to define reusable habits in the management view. Then use a drop down to select from that list of habits when creating a schedule. even though two items on the schedule could be the same habit, they should be treated as two separate event to complete throughout the day. make sure the overall data model for the project is structured accordingly. 
8. overdue items in the schedule view should be highlighted red, completed items should be hidden in the schedule view by default. include a button to show completed items if I want. sort all schedule items in chronological order, regardless of status or if completed items are shown. 
9. add habits for each excercise I should do for a given workout during the week. include number of reps and sets. make sure all detailed items in SCHEDULE.md are created as habits in the app. 
10. I also have a pilonidal cyst. I like to make sure it is clean and hair free using hair removal cream. define specific habits and integrate a schedule for caring for this cyst as well. I apply hair removal cream from my testicles to my butt crack, and lower back. I use a hair trimmer on my butt cheeks, thighs, and remaining pubic hair (need lengths for trimming each body region). define specific habits and integrate a schedule for each body hair task by area. 
11. also create a habit for doing laundry weekly. 
12. create a habit for reviewing financials weekly. 
13. optimize my habit schedule with all the new habits I've requested
14. in my initial commit and push to github, I included TODO.md. I want to remove this from the remote branch and ignore it from future commits
